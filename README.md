Essential Questions

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs requires continuous communication with stakeholders to ensure their expectations are well-understood and prioritized. In this project, user stories were essential for translating these needs into actionable tasks. For example, breaking down the travel booking user story into smaller tasks—UI design, booking logic, and payment processing—ensured clarity and incremental delivery. User stories kept the team focused on delivering features that directly aligned with client expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to development prioritizes iterative and incremental progress, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability. The Scrum-Agile processes, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Retrospectives, provided structure and allowed the team to address changes effectively. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate Agile practices like maintaining a Definition of Done (DoD) to ensure deliverable quality and using tools like Jira and burndown charts for efficient progress tracking.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member involves active participation, open communication, and collaboration. In this project, team members addressed blockers during daily stand-ups, participated in code reviews, and supported each other to meet sprint goals. A good team member also embraces feedback, fosters a positive team dynamic, and ensures the success of the collective effort over individual priorities.
