Reflection: What I Learned

Through CS 255, I gained hands-on experience in systems analysis, UML modeling, and software documentation. I learned how to create detailed system blueprints using UML diagrams and analyze different software development methodologies. The DriverPass project helped me understand the importance of clear documentation and structured system design.
